### Download Demo

You can isolate vocals and obtain as a .wav file if you have python.
To extract vocals from any song: download _voiceolation_ and install libraries on the requirements.txt.

1. Download and extract the .zip file
2. Install libraries from the requirements.txt
3. Run the below command giving a path of the sound file
```
py voiceolation.py <path-to-soundfile>
```

If you want more accurate result, change SR on the config.py because we are using downsampling.

P.S: This a student project, may not be satisfied but it doesn't hurt to give a chance and try :)
